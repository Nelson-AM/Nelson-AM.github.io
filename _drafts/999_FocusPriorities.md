Notes on Thomas Frank’s video.

- Too many interests, difficult to find one thing to focus on.
	- AKA the paradox of choice.
- How to narrow done career choices?
- Option 1:
	- Exercise: write down top 25 (career) goals. Circle 5 most important goals.
	- List A: 5 most important goals.
		- Most Important things to focus on.
	- List B: 20 less important goals.
		- Less important so less focus? No, disregard.
		- Avoid at all costs list.
		- Risk of being a distraction from the 5 items list.
- Option 2:
	- Create a /now page.
	- Public declaration of priorities.
	- Private reminder of what I’m working on, to stay focused.
