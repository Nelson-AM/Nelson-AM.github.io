# Work-Life Balance

## Outline

* What's my current working position and where do I come from?
    * First job. Master's (research projects).
    * Briefly describe situation (at a company working for a client, on _their_ (proprietary) software).
* What's my stance on WLB?
    * What has changed between university and now?
    * How has my view on WLB changed over the past year?

## Draft
Work-life balance is very important to me, and I think it should be for everyone. In university, by virtue of being a student, I took my work home with me. Homework. As was expected. Towards the end, though, while working on my thesis and final research project I did my best to be at university full-time and do most of the work there. Nonetheless, I still took work home with me and I did (some) personal things while I was at uni. Partially, this was the case because I used a laptop for both work and personal stuff, so there was no real digital separation.

Now that I'm working at a business I have a desktop PC at work and my laptop at home. Working from home would be the only time that I would use my personal laptop for work-purposes. Because of this, I tend to leave my work behind me as soon as I walk out of the office.

* Digital separation of work and personal.
    * How have I organised the shared space?
        * Access to email / google drive.
        * Separate Dropbox accounts (personal and professional).
        * Git & GitHub access for code-related things (kanas, exercises).
    * What is relevant to have both at work and at home.
        * General notes on programming, some files (coaching, personal development).

### Stress
* Do I take stress home with me?
* How does that make me feel?

One thing I _do_ take home with me is work-stress. That's something I have a hard time letting go of, because I can't just shut off those stress-hormones as soon as I walk out the door.
