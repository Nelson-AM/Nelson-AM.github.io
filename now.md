This page serves as a reminder to myself what I want to focus on, as well as a public declaration of my priorities.

## What I'm Doing Now

*This page has been updated on: 14-04-2019.*

I'm based in Amsterdam, sharing a flat with my partner and two cats. By day, I'm a software developer.

Beside my day-job, my priorities are:

* physical health: running regularly and trying to figure out a good bodyweight routine;
* organising my physical and digital spaces;
* improving my house through small renovations;
* organising PyData Amsterdam meetups and conference.
