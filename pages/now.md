This page serves as a reminder to myself what I want to focus on, as well as a public declaration of (some of) my priorities.

## What I'm Doing Now

*This page has been updated on: 20-02-2025.*

My priorities right now are (in no particular order):

- Studying to become OCP 17 certified,
- Gardening & home maintenance,
- Maintaining my sourdough starter and baking bread,
- Physical fitness &ndash; mainly running & climbing.
