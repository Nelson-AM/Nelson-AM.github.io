This page serves as a reminder to myself what I want to focus on, as well as a public declaration of my priorities.

## What I'm Doing Now

*This page has been updated on: 02-02-2020.*

I'm based in Amsterdam, sharing a flat with my partner and two cats. By day, I'm a software developer.

Beside my day-job, my priorities are (in no particular order):

* organising my physical and digital spaces;
* improving my house through small renovations;
* physical health;
* organising PyData Amsterdam meetups and conference.
